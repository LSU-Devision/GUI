## Raspberry Pi Camera Support

If you are running this application on a Raspberry Pi and want to use the Pi camera, you must install the `picamera` package manually:

```bash
pip install picamera
```

This step is only required for Raspberry Pi users who want to use the Pi camera. On other systems, only `opencv-python` is required for webcam support.
